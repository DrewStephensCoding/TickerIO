# TickerIO
**TickerIO** A minimalistic clock app built to quickly display the local date and time as well as the Universal Coordinated time, or Zulu military time. It started off as a project while deployed to the Middle East several years ago, and quickly became a side hobby for me.  I'm a self-taught developer and looking to expand my knowledge and skillset.

## Motivation
Motivation for this project came out of a minor necessity.  I was deployed overseas and needed something to quickly give me a variety of time and date formats for our aircraft inspections, while being user friendly.  The apps on my phone at the time didn't meet this expectation, and I was already learning Android development, so as an actual product I designed something I needed.  TickerIO was born.
