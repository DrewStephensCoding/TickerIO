# TickerIO
**TickerIO** A minimalistic clock app built to quickly display the local date and time as well as the Universal Coordinated time, or Zulu military time. It started off as a project while deployed to the Middle East several years ago, and quickly became a side hobby for me.  I'm a self-taught developer and looking to expand my knowledge and skillset
